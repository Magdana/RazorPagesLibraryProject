    <p>Our History</p>
    <div class="history-cont">
        <p>Founded with a passion for literature and a vision to connect communities through the power of books, our library has been a cornerstone of knowledge and inspiration since its inception in 2005. From humble beginnings with a modest collection of 500 books, we have grown into a vibrant hub with over 50,000 titles, catering to readers of all ages and interests.</p>
        <p>Over the years, we have expanded our offerings to include not only a wide range of books but also engaging events such as book clubs, literacy workshops, and author meet-and-greets. Our library is more than just a place to borrow books—it's a welcoming space where creativity flourishes, ideas are shared, and connections are made.</p>
        <p>Each chapter of our story reflects our unwavering commitment to fostering a love for reading and lifelong learning, ensuring that our library remains a timeless treasure for generations to come.</p>
